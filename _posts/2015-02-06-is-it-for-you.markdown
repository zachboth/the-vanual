#### Different experiences for different people

The variety of people you'll find living and traveling in a van is wide and all-encompassing. You'll find climbers and outdoor enthusiasts who enjoy spending the maximum time out in nature. Former desk jockeys now doing freelance work with ever-changing scenery. Penny pinching young professionals avoiding exorbitant rent prices in the city. Newlyweds starting the new chapter of their lives on the road together.

Whatever your reason, your experience of living a mobile lifestyle will differ from anyone elses. Your budget, your van, your preferences, your plan, all of these aspects will give you a personal bias towards what you like or dislike about vanlifeâ€”what works for you and what doesn't. My hope is to share the things I've personally learned during my first six months of living and traveling in a van. Some of my "tips and tricks" might apply to you. Some might not. Take it all with a grain of salt.

#### The positives of vanlife

There are many extraordinary benifits to living in a van. If there weren't, this site wouldn't exist! The few I've listed below is just the tip of the iceberg:

- **Freedom.** The ability to go where you want when you want for as long as you want can't be underestimated. It's something very few of us ever get to experience during our lifetimes. 
- **Cost-effective.** If you're smart (and budget well) you can live in the most beautiful places in the world for a small fraction of what others pay. The villa looking out over ocean cliffs or some snowcapped mountain? You can wake up to that same beautiful view... for free.
- **Community.** As soon as you buy a van, you join a club that has existed for decades. A club of individuals who have embarked on the open road in a van. It's a community of people that are easy to get along with and quick to offer support.

#### The negatives of vanlife

As many upsides as there are to living in a van, there are just as many downsides. It's important to be honest and frank about these as they could be a deal breaker for those considering the vanlife:

- **Inconvenience.** The simplest things you probably take for granted while living in a stationary home can take two, three, four times as long while living in a van. Almost everything requires a bit of planning. This includes using wifi, going to the bathroom, taking a shower, doing laundry and cooking. Most of the inconvenience comes from having to go out and find public options for these.
- **Lonliness.** Even if you regard yourself as a bit of a lone wolf (I do), the constant solitude can eventually generate feelings of lonliness. The cure to this is simple. Get out of your comfort zone every once in a while and talk to the people you meet on the trail, in the grocery store, at the bar or on the street. And make sure to meet up with old friends when they're there.
- **Legal grey area.** In many places around the US it's frowned upon by local law enforcement to live in your vehicle. In a few cities it's even downright illegal (looking at you Palo Alto). However, if you follow local parking laws and are discreet, no one will know or care. There are also plenty of awesome towns and pieces of public land that welcome van dwellers with open arms.
