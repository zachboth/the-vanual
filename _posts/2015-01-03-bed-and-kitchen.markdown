#### <span class="number"><span>1</span></span> Measure and cut plywood for bed

A bit tricky as your walls may have a slight curve to them. Since the lifting bed doors need to be square the sides will need to be adjusted to take into account this curve. Include a middle strut that will be used to attach your bed doors to.

#### <span class="number"><span>2</span></span> Build bed using braces

Using the same technique as done with the walls, the bed was assembled by securing them with braces and attaching them to the wheel well boxes. A middle column was constructed to support the middle strut of the bed.

#### <span class="number"><span>3</span></span> Attach bed hinges and install pneumatic lift and locks

After figuring out the exact angle for a futon backrest, 100lb pneumatic struts were secured to the bed doors and to the wheel wells. Attach as high as possible on the wheel wells to maximize the space you can use when the doors are in the down position.

#### <span class="number"><span>4</span></span> Build kitchen walls and shelves using a mix of braces and struts

Lots of measuring. A good amount of cutting. The main thing to remember is to start with the kitchen walls square. If they're not you'll need to trace your shelves over the area they are being secured to to ensure they fit properly. 

To secure the walls to the van use chopped off screws and drilled holes in the floor to keep the walls in place. Then build braces to support the shelves.

#### <span class="number"><span>5</span></span> Cut and attach doors with hinges and magnets

Cut the doors to size. For doors you want permenantly in place secure using heavy duty hinges. If you want the option to remove the door completely inset rare earth magnets both into the door and within the kitchen unit itself.

#### <span class="number"><span>6</span></span> Build slide out drawer (optional)

For the space below my fridge I wanted a large drawer for cooking and eating utensils. Its a simple open-faced box, but for the sliding mechanism I just used long strips of felt on the bottom to slide along the floor. It's kept in place when closed with more inset magnets.

#### <span class="number"><span>7</span></span> Alter futon bed to fit

Originally I planned on getting a custom futon made to fit to size. However with a lack of time and funds, I went a more inexpensive route. Bought a used ikea futon on craigslist, opened the cover and snipped the springs to the length  that I needed. My mother then graciously sewed this up and made an additional cover over the mattress.

#### <span class="number"><span>8</span></span> Make table

To accomadate more people or more space when eating, cooking or working, a table was made that is essentially just a board that can rest between my kitchen unit and the opposite wall. It was custom cut to fit snug into the specific indentations of the wall. A small piece of lath was secured to the bottom to keep it from moving when in place.

When not in use this is stored behind the driver seat.

#### <span class="number"><span>9</span></span> Build stool trash can

Probably the most functional element of the entire van. It's simple wood box with a removable lid with a fabric wrapped cushion secured to the top. A slightly smaller open-faced was built to sit inside the larger box to accomodate a trash bag, essentially turning the inside of the stool into a trashcan!

Felt was attached to the bottom so the stool can be moved about without scratching the floor.
