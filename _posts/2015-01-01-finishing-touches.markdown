#### <span class="number"><span>1</span></span> Tape for painting

You'll be painting a lot so make sure to do a top notch job taping anything you don't want painted. I failed to do this and got paint on various things I did not want paint on. A touch up job and some heavy cleaning was required.

#### <span class="number"><span>2</span></span> Paint and stain

To paint most of the wood work I used one coat of white primer and two coats of a high gloss paint with a light sanding in between coats. I found the high gloss sheen works best because it makes it very difficult to stain and incredibly easy to clean.

The fronts of the cabinets were then stained the same color as the ceiling plywood. And finally the sheet metal on the popup windows were painted with black chalkboard spray paint. Do multiple layers with light sanding in between to get a smooth chalkboard. Do not use the roll-on chalkboard paint as it leaves an undesired texture after drying.

#### <span class="number"><span>3</span></span> Attach paneling to kitchen doors (optional)

Using the same print out pattern/template as the ceiling, I marked and secured pieces of lath to the cabinet doors.

#### <span class="number"><span>4</span></span> Attach "lighting shelves" and install LED lights

With more leftover lath, I trimmed the length of the wood at an angle to ensure it was parallel to the floor when attached. On each side of the van I ran the LED lights from the front to the back and back to the front (for a total of two layers deep of LED lights on each side). These two rolls of LEDs (one on each side) produces a lot of light if I need it. Luckily they can be dimmed to much lower for normal use.

#### <span class="number"><span>5</span></span> Sew magnetic blackout curtains for windows

My mother is an excellent seamstress and offered to help the cause by making my curtains. I produced a paper template for each window and she used that to alter a blackout curtain to fit. Little rare earth magnets were sewn in various places along the edges. This allows these window coverings to be easily put up or removed.

#### <span class="number"><span>6</span></span> Sew and hang front divider curtain with pole

Another curtain was made to to divide the front driving area and the rest of the van. The curtain is doublesided. The driver side has a blackout curtain while the living area has a white curtain. Additional templates were made to fit the odd shapes along the sides. The curtain is then fed through a pole that extends across the entire width of the van. Finally the curtain can be stretched taut with some snaps I installed on the side walls.

#### <span class="number"><span>7</span></span> Cut and attach new door panels

Not liking the black plastic that covers the doors, I removed them, used these covers to make templates for each door and then cut new covers out of 1/4" plywood. The plywood was then secured using slightly countersunk screws. The screws were then filled and the entire cover stained to match.

#### <span class="number"><span>8</span></span> Build "cleaning" station

I actually had the idea and built this cleaning station while on the road. I'm so glad I did. It's simple but saves the headache of opening storage everytime I need to clean or wipe something down. Three-faced box was built and secured to the door with chopped off screws, a nailer and some caulk. The paper towel holder was bought at a store.

It's done. Stand back. Celebrate. Take some photos and then hit the road! Your real adventure has just begun.
