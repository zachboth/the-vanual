#### <span class="number"><span>1</span></span> First things first

Contrary to what is implied with the name of this site, the information provided here is less of a strict paint-by-number manual, and more of a general guide that you can stick to or deviate from as much as you want. 

Depending on your budget, vehicle, or just general requirements your experience may differ considerably from what is outlined in this guide. However, there are many tried and true practices most van conversions follow. My hope is you'll be able to use my journey as a resource throughout your van conversion adventure.

#### <span class="number"><span>2</span></span> Do I need carpentry experience?

No! Carpentry experience is not required! Before setting off with my van conversion, the last time I touched a power tool was when I built the world's simplest bench as a highschooler. Luckily the conversion process is conducive to learning general carpentry skills in an incremental fashion. Every step builds off of what you did previously. 

You're going to make mistakes and get frustrated along the way. It's going to take a significant amount of time. This is normal. By the end of the conversion process, you'll have developed a whole new set of skills that will empower you to build and create for a lifetime to come.

#### <span class="number"><span>3</span></span> Time spent on conversion

I spent a total of four months turning my empty cargo van into a finished camper. Seems like a long time doesn't it? It is. After quitting my job, I was working on the van almost everyday while the sun was up.

So how can you speed up the process? Convert your van during the summer. Longer days, more sun and warmer weather will dramatically increase your productivity. Rope an extra person (or two!) into helping you. My dad helped me quite a lot on this project, however, we estimated I did 70% of the work by myself and 30% with the two of us. Needless to say, two definitely get more done than just one. Lastly, be less picky. I'm known to be a stickler for the details—which can be a good thing—except when everything takes three times as long because you can't decide on the perfect shade of brown for the wood stain.

#### <span class="number"><span>4</span></span> Money spent on conversion

The empty van with new tires and repairs (that we did ourselves) cost around $6k. The cost of materials and tools to convert the van ballooned to around $5k. This made the total cost of the van conversion around $11k. If I added in the things I bartered for (fridge and solar) the total would jump to almost $15k. That's a lot of money! And definitely more money than I planned on spending. However, since I saw this project as more of a personal design exercise and fantastic learning opportunity, I felt like I could justify the cost.

There are people who've—out of necessity—converted their vans for only a few hundred dollars. It's possible. For every material and tool I used there are cheaper alternatives that will shave off major money from the total cost. Alter an Ikea shelving unit instead of building custom cabinets. Use strand board instead of birch plywood. Don't paint. Simplify your needs and requirements. These are all things that can reduce cost.

#### <span class="number"><span>5</span></span> Designing the van's layout

There's a reason almost all van conversions look quite different from one another. Each person and each van has a unique set of requirements. While I—being a shorter individual—can manage sleeping perpendicular to the walls of the van, taller folks will need a longer bed and thus a different van layout. I planned on cooking most meals, so I valued a decent amount of space for a stove, refrigerator and pantry. Others who plan on eating out or eating simpler could use that kitchen space for something else entirely.

There is one quality that is true of every successful van conversion: space is used effeciently. There's not a wasted inch and almost every part of the van should have multiple uses. In my case, my bed also functioned as a couch and my main place of storage. My kitchen doubled as a desk and a dining area. Finding ways to combine functions in a modular way is the key to squeezing the most out of a small space.

#### <span class="number"><span>6</span></span> Designing the van's look and feel

I've done design work off and on for the better part of 5 years. This meant I quite enjoyed the challenge of creating a camper van that was unique and incorporated my aesthetic preferences in a meaningful way. Using Photoshop I combined minimalist scandinavian design principles with a tiny hint of nautical and industrial style to mockup a look that ended up being surprisingly close to what the final product looked like.

Whether your style leans more rustic, more "hippie" or something else entirely, try to imagine what you want your van to look like like when it's all said and done. Those broad choices will most likely impact the materials you use or the way you use them.
