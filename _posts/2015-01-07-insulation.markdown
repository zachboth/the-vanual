#### <span class="number"><span>1</span></span> Cut reflectix to fit wall

Precut the reflectix to roughly the same size as the section of wall you’re covering. Then after applying duct tape to temporarily hold it up, run a sharpie along the edges and curves to get an accurate pattern of where to cut.

#### <span class="number"><span>2</span></span> Glue reflectix to wall

Use heavy duty spray adhesive to permenately attach the reflectix to the wall. Spray on backside of reflectix. Spray on wall. Wait 5 minutes. Line up reflectix to wall and firmly press.

This stuff is sticky, so try to line it up to exactly the right place before you apply. It’s difficult to move around afterwards.

#### <span class="number"><span>3</span></span> Cut and glue reflectix to ceiling

No special templates for this. For my van, the roof width was exactly the same width as the roll of reflectix. Just had to measure length and cut. 

You can use the spray adhesive to attach reflectix to the ceiling, but I just used Tyvek tape around the edges. Holds up fine.

#### <span class="number"><span>4</span></span> Cut rigid foam paneling to cover upper panels and ceiling

Measure and cut the rigid foam to fit into the cieling and the popout panels (if you have them). These should go over the reflectix. If you cut the foam just ever so slightly larger than it needs to be, you can squeeze the paneling into it’s spot and it’ll stay without any assistance. Probably still good to tape the edges with Tyvek for added precaution.

#### <span class="number"><span>5</span></span> Spray foam in every remaining crack, crevice and gap

Couple tips for foaming. Do not use the “Big Gap Filler” unless you want foam bellowing out of the gaps 12 hours later. It just expands too much relative to what you spray. Makes it difficult to control. Instead, use the step down: “Gap and Crack Filler”. 

Also, avoid foaming during cold weather (or at least use a heater for the entirety of foaming). It won’t setup properly and then 2 months later, when it gets warmer, you’ll find foam oozing out of your woodwork. 

Lastly, if you have REALLY big open gaps to fill, foam about a third or half of the depth and let it it dry. Once it dries, foam the rest. If you don’t do this, the weight of the foam will just push out onto your floor and cause a huge mess.

After it’s fully setup and dry, trim excess foam.

#### <span class="number"><span>6</span></span> Make paper template for floor to cut reflectix and rigid  paneling

Using the paper scrap method, make a template of your floor with a roll of rose paper. If you are extremely detailed with this template, it will save a lot of time and headache later on. 

Additionally, if you take really good care of this template (making sure not to wrinkle, tear or otherwise damage it), you’ll be able to use this template for the insulation AND subflooring. Two birds with one stone.

#### <span class="number"><span>7</span></span> Attach reflectix and rigid paneling to floor

Since your reflectix and rigid foam will likely be smaller than you’re template, you’ll have to figure out some sort of mosaic layout. Try to lay it out effeciently so you’re wasting the least amount of material.

Trace the template onto your mosaic of material and cut. Then use tyvek tape to tape the seams (tape the reflectix outside the van, tape the rigid foam once it’s all in place inside the van). Once inside the van, tape the edges of the insulation to the van so it doesn’t move.

#### <span class="number"><span>8</span></span> Cut, stuff and attach fiberglass insulation to walls

Last bit of insulation is the fiberglass insulation for the bottom-half of your walls (or your full wall if your van doesn’t have windows or pop-out panels). Do the same thing you did with the wall reflectix and cut to roughly the same size then trim to fit curves and odd shapes.

Put the fiberglass insulation into thick garbage bags and Tyvek tape any openings or tears to form a moisture-proof barrier. Some modification of the garbage bags will be necessary. 

Lastly, tape the insulated garbage bags to the walls in their appropriate places.
