#### <span class="number"><span>1</span></span> Alter and install roof rack

If you have solar panels you will probably need some sort of rack to secure them to your roof (without having to drill into your roof).

Personally, I picked up an old Hummer cargo rack and some cargo bars off of craigslist. Pops altered the cargo bars to fit and bolted the rack to those. Sturdy as a rock.

</ul>

#### <span class="number"><span>2</span></span> Install solar panels

Your solar panels should come with there own mounting hardware and instructions. Follow them and you'll be fine.

#### <span class="number"><span>3</span></span> Run solar wiring to the inside

Drill a hole below the roof's rain gutter. Run the solar panel wiring inside and caulk around the hole to create a watertight seal.

#### <span class="number"><span>4</span></span> Run wiring for lights and dimmer

While the lights are not up yet, you can still get the wiring in place. You'll need to drill holes in the back of you kitchen unit to where the dimmer is located.

#### <span class="number"><span>5</span></span> Hook up wiring for fan and fridge

The wiring for the fan and lights should meet to where you can heat shrink them together forming what looks like a single cable. The fridge will require you to drill another hole in the wall between your fridge and solar generator. I used these 12v quick connects to make it easy to connect into the Goal Zero Yeti inputs. The fridge connects using a 12v car port adapter.
