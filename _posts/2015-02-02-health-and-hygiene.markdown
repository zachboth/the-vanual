#### General van tidiness

The easiest way to keep yourself healthy and sane living in a van is to keep the inside of your vehicle clean and uncluttered. Keeping your living confined to such a small space means that all the mess, all the germs, all the dirt that typically accumulates within an entire apartment or house is now in the 6' x 10' box you call home. To combat this I make it a top priority to keep my home clean and tidy.

Everyday, usually after cooking, I'll habitually wipe down my counterspace and lightly sweep my floor with a hand broom. Once a week, I'll have a "chore day". This is the day I wash my clothes and sheets at the laundromat, buy my groceries and clean most of the surfaces with disenfecting sprayâ€”including the inside of my fridge. And finally, once every month or two I'll empty everything from my van and deeply clean all the cracks and corners of my storage area and kitchen cabinets. This is also the time that I decide if there's anything I can do without and get rid of.

#### Showering

One of the most common questions I get asked by people is "Where do you shower?" My answer is not as exciting as it could be. 90% of the time I shower at the gym. If you're in an area for an extended amount of time, you could get a gym membership at one of the many chain gyms around the US. In smaller communities with less people, there is usually only one or two locally owned and operated gyms. To take a shower when passing through these towns, I'll go in and tell them I just moved here (they don't need to know I moved here just for the day or week) and that I'd like a trial membership for their gym. Usually you have to go on a short 5-minute tour of the gym facilities, but afterwards they give you a trial pass to use for typically around a week. If this method is borderline unethical for you, almost every gym will offer a day pass that you can purchase for around $5/day. 

Getting further from established cities and closer to popular nature destinations, you may find yourself washing off at a campground shower facility. However, when you're far from any other living being (aka middle of nowhere), do what are ancestors did and find a river or a lake and wash off there. 

Finally, if you go through a town where you have a friend (or a friend of a friend) be shameless in asking them to take a shower at their place. Could be the difference between you smelling like a normal upstanding citizen and one of those orcs from Middle Earth.

#### Number one and number two

This is common sense people. For both peeing and pooping, you'll be taking advantage of the endless supply of public bathrooms. Make it a habit to go #2 where you can before retiring to the van for the night. Otherwise, you may be making an emergency trip to some 24 hour joint in the middle of the night to use their restroom.

However, we have all woken up in the middle of the night having to go pee. You wouldn't want to drive all the way to a place just to use their bathroom to go pee. So what do you do then? Answer: The pee bottle. It's the dirty little secret of any van dweller. For me, I use an opaque laundry detergent bottle. It's discreet, has a wide mouth for minimum mess, a handle for holding, and liquid-tight lid. Every once in a while I'll pour some bleach into it and swish it around to get rid of any unwanted odors or germs. Simple as that.

#### Brushing your teeth

Since I almost always have my backpack or my jacket with large pockets with me when I'm away from the van during the day, I'll usually have my toothbrush and toothpaste on me wherever I go. Again, I'll take advantage of public restrooms in the morning and evening to brush my teeth. Try find a single person restroom that has a locking door, so you can brush your teeth in peace without any strange looks from other bathroom patrons.

If I don't have access to a public restroom, I'll just use a cup of water to wash my mouth out and toothbrush off.

#### Mental health

Living in a van can get claustrophobic and lonely at times which can lead to depression and other mental health problems. Make an active effort to spend as little time during the day inside the van. Instead, go outside, explore new places, talk to new people and meet up with friends. This will ensure your mind stays happy and healthy.
